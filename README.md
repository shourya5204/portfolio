Modern single-page portfolio for Shourya (ready to deploy)

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- resume.pdf

How to deploy (recommended: Vercel via GitHub):
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public). Name it e.g. "portfolio".
2. Unzip these files and push them to the repo (index.html at repo root).
3. Go to https://vercel.com/import and import your GitHub repo.
4. Vercel will auto-deploy a static site. Use the generated URL in your resume.

If you'd like, I can provide exact git commands to push the folder to GitHub locally.
